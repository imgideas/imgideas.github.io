Cotton cellulose differs from wood and rayon cellulose by having higher degrees of polymerization and crystallinity. Since cotton reproduce sexually, cotton offspring receive two copies (or alleles) of every gene—one from each parent. Cotton is composed of pure cellulose , a biopolymer made up of glucose molecules , which appears in the form of white specks of soft, fluffy fabric, highly permeable to air , thus quickly absorbing moisture. But in terms of comfort.
