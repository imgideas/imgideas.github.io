【easy to use】using our double stick tape heavy duty mounting is very easy:1.keep liner on tape &amp;cut to any size 2.place tape on area and remove liner 3.align object to tape and press firmly for 60 seconds. If possible, leave the decorations that need tape to hung, until the last hour or two, because the longer the tape stays on the wall, the harder it. While doing so make sure that the sticky part is facing for outside. When hanging these decorations on painted walls, then the tape can do some pretty heavy damage to the paint unless you�re very careful while hanging the decorations and about the type of tape you choose.
