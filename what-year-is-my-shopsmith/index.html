I bought my shopsmith in 1973 and built a lot of furniture with it. Ive had my shopsmith since 1988, so they last a long time as long as you take care of it. Shopsmith, inc., was formed in 1972 to resume manufacturing using all the original equipment. I first bought my shopsmith in 1981 but didn�t get it set up until i actually bought my first house in 1985 where it fit nicely in my single car garage.
